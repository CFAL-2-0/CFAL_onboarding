# Introduction

In the Computational Fluids and Aerodynamics Laboratory, we leverage cutting-edge computing and software to advance understanding of fluid dynamics. Even though fluid dynamics is such a broad category (aerodynamics, multiphase, compressible, aeroacoustics, you get the idea), there are a few concepts everybody in the lab utilizes to some extent. The goal of this onboarding is to get you familiar with some of these concepts, so you can get to the fun part of your research!

# Getting Started
Here, we will go over a few items that are required for the rest of the onboarding.
## Important downloads
There are a few pieces of software the CFAL members use on a day-to-day basis.

* [Microsoft 365](https://myerauedu.sharepoint.com/sites/IT/SitePages/microsoft-office-365.aspx?web=1) (should be able to download through your ERAU account)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - this is the preferred text editor for the lab. Also includes SSH tools for connecting to HPC/lab computers
* [MobaXTerm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html) A powerful remote access tool, typically used for SSH connections but can be used for remote desktop connections as well.
* [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) WinSCP (Windows SCP) is a file transfer software. Makes it easy to transfer a large number of files between computers.
